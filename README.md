Hello_World!
This is Nick and Aaron's soc504 spring 2015 replication project repo. 
<br>
<br>
To Do as of 2-19-2015: <br>
1) learn how to apply grand weights to data waves <br>
2) join waves 1 and 3 together by the ID key <br>
3) Select out only the variables of interest (acculturation measures, sexual behavior measures) <br>
4) Mutate new STD variable <br>
5) Dicotomize (sp?) variables either 0 or 1 <br>
<br>
6) Make a new to do list once points 1 through 5 are complete. 
<br><br>
Sexual risk behaviors: <br>
1) Self report of ever having an STD (1 = has had 1 or more, 0 = never had STD) <br>
2) Four or more sexual partners (1 = has had 4 or more sexual partners, 0 = fewer than 4 sexual partners) <br>
3) Sexual contact that was later regretted due to alcohol use (1 = has felt regret, 0 = has not felt regret) <br>
4) Condom use in last sexual contact (1 = no condom use, 0 = condom was used) <br> <br>

Chlamydia: H3SE21A <br>
